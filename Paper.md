<h1> Trapezoid Rule in F# </h1>

Numerical is approximate; analytical is exact.

A numerical method is a tool used to find a numerical solution to a problem which can be difficult to solve analitically.
Mostly done by computers, this approach is a complete set of instructions that are executed in order to find a solution. With this being said,
the Trapezoidal Rule is a numerical method used to find definite integrals. The most common application for this method is to find the 
area under a function in a given set of intervals. Finding this area is tipically done using Riemann sums, but this method proves to be more
exact.
